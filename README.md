# 2DIncompressibleSG

This code was designed to implement a solver for the incompressible semi-geostrophic equations in two dimensions using the geometric method. 

For more details on the functions of this code see the three dimensional impelmentation. 

For more details about the initial condition see the original implementation (https://github.com/CharliePEgan/SG-Eady-slice) of this code which was done in MATLAB.
